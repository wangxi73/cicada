        - summary: at most 3 short sentences.
        - Topics in time order, at most 8 in total. A topic is a stretch of the meeting, usually 3-10 minutes, not a single remark: start a new one only when the subject clearly changes and the current topic started at least 2 minutes before the newest line\(final ? "" : "; add at most one new topic per update"). Otherwise add to the current one, and merge small neighbouring topics. Keep earlier topics as they are unless new lines correct them. The last topic is the one being discussed now.
        - At most 4 points per topic, each one short phrase. Merge rather than repeat.
        - At most 5 conclusions and only real to-dos (often none).
        - Add a fishbone only to a topic that discusses causes, reasons or factors (3-5 branches); otherwise null.
        - Every topic, point, branch, conclusion and to-do needs evidence: the ids of the lines that say it. Never state anything the transcript does not say.
        - terms: at most 10 in total, replacing less useful ones rather than adding: first names the transcript misspells (heard), then the people, places and jargon a reader would not know. Leave out what everyone knows (a famous company, index or politician) unless it was misheard. name is the correct spelling in the transcript's language (no translation in brackets); heard lists only the wrong forms the transcript used; note is a few words.
        - Write the meeting title and every summary, title, point, branch, conclusion and to-do in \(language), even when the transcript is in another language. Only term names keep the transcript's spelling.
        - Write about what was said, never about the transcript or recognition quality.
